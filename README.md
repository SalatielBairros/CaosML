# Caos Learn - A Machine Learning Library reference for studying purposes

## Introduction

This repository implements some machine learning algorithms from scratch using Python. The main purpose of this repository is to serve as a reference for studying purposes. The algorithms implemented here are:

- Linear Regression

Each algorithm has its own folder with a README.md file explaining the algorithm and how to run it.
More information will be added here in the future as more algorithms are implemented.
