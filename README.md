# Caos Learn - A Machine Learning Library reference for studying purposes

## Introduction

This repository implements some machine learning algorithms from scratch using Python. The main purpose of this repository is to serve as a reference for studying purposes.

### Why Caos?

The name "caos" is because all learning is caotic. You'll have joy and frustration at the same time. Also the development of this project itself is surrounded by caos: I have a toddler at home always asking what I am doing.

### Implemented algorithms

Each algorithm has its own folder with a README.md file explaining the algorithm and how to run it. All the explanations are written in Portuguese, but the code is written in English to facilitate the comparison with other implementations.
More information will be added here in the future as more algorithms are implemented.

- [Linear Regression](https://github.com/SalatielBairros/CaosML/tree/main/src/linear_model/linear_regression)
- [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/SalatielBairros/CaosML/tree/main/src/linear_model/logistic_regression)
- [KNN](https://github.com/SalatielBairros/CaosML/tree/main/src/neighbors/knn)
- [DecisionTreeClassifier](https://github.com/SalatielBairros/CaosML/tree/main/src/tree)

### Current implementing:

- Random Forest

### Next

- K-Means
